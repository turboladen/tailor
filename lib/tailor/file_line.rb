  # Calling modules will get the Ruby file to check, then read by line.  This
  # class allows for checking of line-specific style by Represents a single
  # line of a file of Ruby code.  Inherits from String so "self" can be used.
  #
  # Methods are named such that they check for bad style conditions, and return
  # true and print the associated error message when the bad style condition
  # is discovered in the file line.
