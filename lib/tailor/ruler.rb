class Tailor

  # This is a composite class, geared for getting at or managing the Rulers
  # that should be used for measuring style.  To do so, create a new object of
  # this type, then add child rulers to that object using +#add_child_ruler+.
  # After using the Ruler, you'll have access to all of the problems found by
  # all of the child rulers via +#problems+.
  #
  # Example:
  #   ruler = Ruler.new
  #   file_length_ruler = FileLengthRuler.new
  #   ruler.add_child_ruler(file_length_ruler)
  #   # use ruler
  #   ruler.problems      # => [{ all of your file length problems... }]
  #
  # There's really no measuring functionality in this base class--it's merely
  # for aggregating child data and for providing a base class to create child
  # Rulers from.  Speaking of... if you want, you can create your own rulers.
  # A Ruler requires a few things:
  #
  # First, it needs a list of Lexer events to observer.  Tailor uses its Lexer
  # to publish events (in this case, characters or string Ruby constructs) of
  # interest to its observers.  Rulers subscribe to those events so that they
  # can detect the problems they're looking for.  These are defined as a Set in
  # +@lexer_observers+.  Adding to that list means the Ruler will subscribe to
  # those events.
  #
  # Example:
  #   class MyRuler < Tailor::Ruler
  #     def initialize
  #       add_lexer_observers = :nl_observer, :kw_observer
  #     end
  #   end
